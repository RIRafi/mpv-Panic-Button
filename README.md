# mpv-Panic-Button
Automatically pauses and minimizes the current window of mpv with just a single click. You can even set the button of your choice. Just edit the "key-bind" variable in the lua script. Currently set to "]"

# installation
lua scripts go in the mpv config folder of your operating systems. I made a simple shell script for linux users to make a simple copy paste easier. (Will make a windows one in the future). Just clone this repository and run the install.sh in your terminal as executable.
